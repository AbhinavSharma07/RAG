# 🚀✨ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 
 
Welcome to your **go-to boilerplate for building powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems**! This repo equips you with the essential tools to combine cutting-edge language models with robust document retrieval — delivering answers that are **accurate**, **context-aware**, and **grounded** in your data.

## 🔍 What is RAG?

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a breakthrough approach that combines:

- 🔎 **Retriever:** Searches your knowledge base (documents, PDFs, databases) to find the most relevant context.
- 🤖 **Generator:** Uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate responses grounded in the retrieved information.

This hybrid method bridges **raw language generation** and **fact-based retrieval** — perfect for applications needing trustworthy AI answers.
